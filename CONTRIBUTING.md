## Issue Tracking System

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, enhancements, and project todos. This section explains how our issue tracking system works.

### Issue Types

We use the following issue types:

- **Bug Reports**: For reporting software bugs and errors
- **Feature Requests**: For suggesting new features
- **Enhancements**: For suggesting improvements to existing features
- **Documentation Issues**: For reporting issues with documentation or suggesting improvements
- **Todo Items**: For tracking project development tasks

### Issue Labels
